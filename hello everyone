[Hello my name is](#mIchael DuVentre). 

I like the idea of coding and it is very intriging but I am soooo confused right now. I am a Memphian (Tennessee).
I served in the United STates Army Reserve as a Chemical Operations Specialist headquarted in Anniston Alabama. I served from 2006-2014
I am currently in the investment INdustry. I look forward to coding.  [Hopefully I did this right](#Fingers#crossed). Thank you.
